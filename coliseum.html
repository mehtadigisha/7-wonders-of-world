<p>Coliseum is a masterpiece of the ancient architecture. This building is manifestation
 of the advancement of ancient Roman architecture. At the same time, Coliseum was
 a cultural center attracting people from different parts of Rome and the 
Mediterranean. In fact, it was a cultural center of the ancient world that made
 Coliseum important not only from artistic but also cultural point of view. Coliseum
 was the entertainment center of the Roman Empire. Coliseum was one of the most
 important architectural works of ancient Rome, which played an important cultural,
 social and political role in Rome. Coliseum was a truly colossal work of ancient
 architects, who had managed to create a masterpiece using resources and 
technologies available to ancient Romans. At the same time, Coliseum mirrored not 
only technological achievements of ancient Romans but also cultural traditions, 
norms and standards of ancient Roman society.</p>

<p>Coliseum was an epical building, which construction had started during the rule of 
Vespasian and was accomplished under the rule of his son, Titus, who honored his
 father on organizing the games in Coliseum, the largest amphitheater of the Roman
 Empire. The history of the construction of Coliseum is very important because this
 amphitheater was constructed by Roman empires to demonstrate their power, the
 greatness of Rome, and their devotedness to traditional Roman values. In this 
respect, it is worth mentioning the fact that Romans had always been concerned 
with entertainments and amphitheaters where gladiators fought and various, often
 bloodthirsty, performances were organized, including symbolic naval battles. In such
 a way, Coliseum became a public place where Roman emperors such as Titus could
 demonstrate their love to Roman people and show their goodness. On the other 
hand, in actuality, Coliseum was a sort of public place where Roman emperors could
 shape their positive public image because, if they attended Coliseum, they hold the
 central place in the whatever performance was organized. </p>
