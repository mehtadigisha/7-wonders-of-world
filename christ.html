    <p>The statue of Christ the Redeemer is probably one of the most recognized images of Brazil .
        It is located in Rio de Janeiro on the top of the Corcovado Mountain . Overlooking the city,
        it probably has one of the best views that can be found of Rio . The statue is currently 72
        years old and has gone under several extensive renovations, which included adding an
        elevator in 2002.</p>

    <p> The statue was first conceived in 1921 when a campaign to gather funds from the
        Catholic Church was held. The idea for the statue came when the country was to celebrate
        100 years of independence. Donations were not received to build the statue until about
        ten years later. The first person commissioned to design the statue was Carlos Oswaldo.
        His vision for the statue was for Christ to be carrying a cross, holding a globe in his hands,
        and standing over a pedestal that was supposed to represent the world. Later, the public
        of Rio thought that Christ with open arms would be the best representation of the city.
        Building for the statue began in 1926 and was completed in 1931, five years later. The
        statue was not sculpted in Brazil ; it was instead sculpted in France by a sculptor whose
        name was Paul Landowski. The pieces of the stature were then shipped over to Brazil
        where they were taken up to the top of the Corcovado Mountain by train and assembled.
        The pieces were made out of soapstone. This material was chosen because of its resistance
        to weather and cracking. The statue, when completed, became the largest art deco
        monument in the world.</p>


    <p> When choosing the site of the statue, several spots where brought up, including
        Sugarloaf Mountain and the Corcovado Mountain . The Corcovado Mountain ended up
        being the resting place for the statue because of its view of the city of Rio and because
        of its height. The Corcovado Mountain provided a more pleasing view of the entire city
        and it was a good bit taller than Sugarloaf, making the statue the tallest structure in
        Rio .</p>

    <p> The view from the top of the statue is the best view of Rio de Janeiro hands down.
        There is a 360 degree view of the entire city. Not only do you see the three famous
        beaches, Copacabana, Ipanema, and Leblon, you also see landmarks such as the Jockey
        Club, the Maracana Stadium, and the Botanical Gardens. The view from the top is not the
        best thing about the statue although. The ride up and down the Corcovado Mountain is by
        far the best part of going to see the statue of Christ the Redeemer. Riding up the mountain
        through the Atlantic rainforest was amazing. This rainforest is not like the ones you will
        find in the Amazon or in other countries such as Costa Rica . When riding down from the
        statue, make sure that you stop and see the waterfalls on the side of the mountain. Also
        stop and take in the view from a different part of the mountain other than the top.</p>
